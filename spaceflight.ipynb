Thus, the spacecraft follows the ellipse (with a periodic change in anomaly), while all other elements are constant.\n\nIn reality though, spacecraft are subject to forces beyond just the gravity of the Earth. First, the Earth itself is not perfectly spherical, and so even the gravitational forces of the Earth are very much dependent on the spacecraft's current latitude, longitude, and altitude. Second, other external bodies, such as the third body gravitational effects of the Sun ☀️ , the Moon 🌒, and other planets like Jupiter and Saturn 🪐 also exert their gravitational influences on their spacecraft, although very weakly. The Earth's atmosphere also exerts a tiny amount of drag in low Earth orbit, and the irradiance of the sun also exerts a radiation pressure on the spacecraft body. Taken altogether, while Earth's gravity is still dominant, over a long period of time, these perturbing forces will derail the prediction of our orbits using our analytical two-body orbit propagator.\n\nMore importantly, most times, we want control over our spacecraft dynamics! We have thrusters on board, we have propulsion, and we want to use our engines to reach for the stars! 🌠🌟\n\nOur thrusters will most intuitively output a change of velocity best described as a vector $\\Delta\\vec{V}$ in XYZ coordinates. Most often, these XYZ coordinates aren't just defined in any inertial coordinate system, but they are defined in a reference frame \"local\" to the spacecraft, such as the local body frame, or the Hill frame.\n\n![Orbit frames](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9NsPo.png \"Orbit frames\")\n\nThus, propagating our orbits numerically, allows us to incorporate more external forces into our force model, such as thrust or drag, instead of relying on a constant of motion such as the mean motion (in the analytical propagator) where we otherwise have no avenue to add these additional forces.",
